This problem contained code written by Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider <waf@illinois.edu>. He provides the initial set up for the code in order to create the Tower of Hanoi problem, and for students to solve it using object oriented programming.

I solved this problem within the files: Game.cpp, Game.h, Stack.cpp, Stack.h, and main.cpp . I did this by implementing the algorithm outlined in Game.cpp and applying it to the rest of the project.
